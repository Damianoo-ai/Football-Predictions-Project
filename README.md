Football Predictions & Analysis Web App
About the Project
This project was born from my passion for sports statistics and analysis — with a special focus on football.
The goal of this web app is to provide users with a comprehensive set of data, charts, and in-depth analyses to study matches and draw insights based on reliable information.

Key Features (Planned)
Pre-Match Analysis — The core of the app. Detailed and customizable statistics to analyze upcoming matches, available at a glance without the need to browse multiple pages.

Live Match Statistics — Real-time stats and data visualization during live games.

Customizable Dashboard — Users will be able to build their own dashboard by selecting the statistics they care most about, making the experience highly tailored.

Advanced Insights — Going beyond basic stats, the app will offer deeper analyses such as:

Coach behavior and playstyle impact on the team's tactics (e.g., wing-focused play, frequent crossing, aggressive pressing).

Tactical trends and patterns.

Team-specific tendencies.

Project Status
⚠️ The project is currently in its early development phase.
I am actively working on building the foundation and designing the core features.

Vision
My goal is to create a powerful tool for football fans, analysts, and enthusiasts — giving them a single place to access meaningful data, perform analyses, and make informed conclusions.
